## Backtracking & Generation
### Generation
1. **Generate binary sequences**  
   Given a positive integer `N`, generate all possible sequences $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_N$, where $b_i \in \{0, 1\}, \left(1 \leq i \leq N\right)$.

2. **List subsets with `m` elements**  
   Given a set $X = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, n\}$, list all subsets containing exactly `m` elements.

3. **List unique permutations**  
   Generate all unique permutations of $n$ elements from set $X = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, n\}$.

### Backtracking
1. **List permutations of `1` to `n`**  
   Input a positive integer `n` and generate all permutations of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \ldots, n$.

2. **Generate unique permutations**  
   List all unique permutations of a set containing `n` elements.

3. **N-Queens Problem**  
   Solve the N-Queens problem using backtracking.
